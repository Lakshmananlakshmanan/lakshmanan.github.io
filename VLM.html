        <b>Happy Diwali to you and all of your loved ones!</b>Let’s celebrate the victory of light over darkness and plant kindness in our hearts so it could grow and fulfill our souls.<br> 
        The great love will always win as long as we believe in it.<br>
        
        
        
        The celebration of light is finally here! It’s very important to remind ourselves that kindness is something that we need to practice.<br>
         Evil lives in every one of us, but we have everything to destroy it. Happy Diwali!
